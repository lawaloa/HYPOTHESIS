    "\n",
    "How does hypothesis testing work and what problems can it solve? To find out, you’ll walk through the workflow for a one sample proportion test. In doing so, you'll encounter important concepts like z-scores, p-values, and false negative and false positive errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chapter 1.1: Hypothesis tests and z-scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, I'm James. Welcome to this course on hypothesis testing in Python. To start, let's look at a real-world example where a hypothesis test was crucial in a decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A/B testing {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013, Electronic Arts, or EA, launched a video game called SimCity 5. Leading up to its release, they wanted to increase pre-order sales. They used an experimental design technique called A/B testing, which has roots in hypothesis testing, to test different advertising scenarios and see which improved sales the most. Website visitors were split into a control group and a treatment group. Each group saw a different version of the game's pre-order sales page.\n",
    "1.\t1 Image credit: \"Electronic Arts\" by majaX1 CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retail webpage A/B test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "Here's each version of the SimCity 5 pre-order page. The control group saw the version with a banner advertising money off their next purchase with each pre-order. The treatment group saw the version without the banner. EA compared the percentage of checkouts for the two groups to see which performed best. Our naive guess would be that the advertisement increased pre-order sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A/B test results {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the A/B test were surprising. The treatment page without the advertisement resulted in 43 percent higher sales than the control page with the advert. The experiment proved that our intuition that more discount adverts would result in more sales was false. We might ask ourselves, was the 43 percent difference a meaningful difference between the control and treatment groups, or was it just random chance? To get this answer, we'd need the original dataset from EA, which isn't publicly available. However, the method to answering this question of significance would involve techniques from both the Sampling in Python course and from this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, Stack Overflow surveys its users, who are primarily software developers, about themselves, how they use Stack Overflow, their work, and the development tools they use. In this course, we'll look at a subset of the survey responses from users who identified as Data Scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesizing about the mean {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's hypothesize that the mean annual compensation of the population of data scientists is 110,000 dollars. We can initially examine the mean annual compensation from the sample survey data. Annual compensation, converted to dollars, is stored in the `converted_comp` column. The sample mean is a type of point estimate, which is another name for a summary statistic. We can calculate it with pandas using the `.mean` method on the `converted_comp` Series. The result is different from our hypothesis, but is it meaningfully different?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a bootstrap distribution {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we need to generate a bootstrap distribution of sample means. This is done by resampling the dataset, calculating the sample mean for that resample, then repeating those steps to create a list of sample means.\n",
    "1.\t1 Bootstrap distributions are taught in Chapter 4 of Sampling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing the bootstrap distribution {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram of the bootstrap distribution is a bell shape. Its bell shape means that it's roughly normally distributed. Notice that 110,000 is on the left of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard error {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the standard deviation of the sample statistics in the bootstrap distribution estimates the standard error of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### z-scores {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since variables have arbitrary units and ranges, before we test our hypothesis, we need to standardize the values. A common way of standardizing values is to subtract the mean, and divide by the standard deviation. For hypothesis testing, we use a variation where we take the sample statistic, subtract the hypothesized parameter value, and divide by the standard error. The result is called a z-score.\n",
    "Here are the values we calculated earlier. The sample mean annual compensation for data scientists of around 120,000 dollars, minus the hypothesized compensation of 110,000, divided by the standard error gives a z-score of one-point-seven-zero-seven.\n",

    "z = \\frac{\\text{sample statistic} - \\text{hypothesized parameter value}}{\\text{standard error}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the hypothesis {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that a big or small number? Determining that is the goal of this course.\n",
    "In particular, we can now state one of the uses of hypothesis testing: determining whether a sample statistic is close to or far away from an expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard normal (z) distribution {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "One final thing. Here's a plot of the probability density function for the standard normal distribution, which is a normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of one. It's often called the z-distribution, and z-scores are related to this distribution. We'll encounter the z-distribution throughout this course.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `late_shipments` dataset contains supply chain data on the delivery of medical supplies. Each row represents one delivery of a part. The `late` columns denotes whether or not the part was delivered late. A value of `\"Yes\"` means that the part was delivered late, and a value of `\"No\"` means the part was delivered on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll begin your analysis by calculating a point estimate (or sample statistic), namely the proportion of late shipments.\n",

We don't know the true value of this population parameter; we can only make inferences about it from the data. Hypothesis tests compare two competing hypotheses. These two hypotheses are the null hypothesis, representing the existing idea, and the alternative hypothesis, representing a new idea that challenges the existing one. They are denoted H-naught and H-A, respectively. Here, the null hypothesis is that the proportion of data scientists that started programming as children follows the research on software developers, at 35 percent. The alternative hypothesis is that the percentage is greater than 35.\n",

Initially, the defendant is assumed to be not guilty and, similarly, we initially assume that the null hypothesis is true. This only changes if the sample provides enough evidence to reject it. Rather than saying we accept the alternative hypothesis, it is convention to refer to rejecting the null hypothesis, or failing to reject the null hypothesis. If the evidence is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the defendant committed the crime, then a \"guilty\" verdict is given.

There are three types of tests, and the phrasing of the alternative hypothesis determines which type we should use. If we are checking for a difference compared to a hypothesized value, we look for extreme values in either tail and perform a two-tailed test. If the alternative hypothesis uses language like \"less\" or \"fewer\", we perform a left-tailed test. Words like \"greater\" or \"exceeds\" correspond to a right-tailed test.

Large p-values mean our statistic is producing a result that is likely not in a tail of our null distribution, and chance could be a good explanation for the result.

    "p-values quantify how much evidence there is for the null hypothesis. Large p-values indicate a lack of evidence for the alternative hypothesis, sticking with the assumed null hypothesis instead. Small p-values make us doubt this original assumption in favor of the alternative hypothesis. What defines the cutoff point between a small p-value and a large one?\n",

    "The cutoff point is known as the significance level, and is denoted alpha. The appropriate significance level depends on the dataset and the discipline worked in. Five percent is the most common choice, but ten percent and one percent are also popular. The significance level gives us a decision process for which hypothesis to support. If the p-value is less than or equal to alpha, we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject it. It's important that we decide what the appropriate significance level should be before we run our test. Otherwise, there is a temptation to decide on a significance level that lets us choose the hypothesis we want.\n",

These are both errors in justice. Similarly, for hypothesis testing, there are two ways to get it right, and two types of error. If we support the alternative hypothesis when the null hypothesis was correct, we made a false positive error. If we support the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis was correct, we made a false negative error. These errors are sometimes known as type one and type two errors, respectively.\n",

    "Here's a dataset of US presidential elections. Each row represents a presidential election at the county level. The variables in the dataset are the US state, the county within that state, and the percentage of votes for the Republican candidate in 2008, and in 2012.\n",

    "\n",
    "One question is whether the percentage of votes for the Republican candidate was lower in 2008 compared to 2012. To test this, we form hypotheses. As before, the null hypothesis is that our hunch is wrong, and that the population parameters are the same in each year group. The alternative hypothesis is that the parameter in 2008 was lower than in 2012. Let's set a significance level of point-zero-five. One feature of this dataset is that the 2008 votes and the 2012 votes are paired, which means they aren't independent, since they both refer to the same county. This means voting patterns may occur due to county-level demographics and local politics, and we want to capture this pairing in our model.\n",

    "#### From two samples to one {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For paired analyses, rather than considering the two variables separately, we can consider a single variable of the difference. This is stored in a DataFrame called `sample_data` with a column named `diff`. In this histogram of the difference, most values are between minus ten and ten, with at least one outlier.\n",

    "We can restate the hypotheses in terms of the single population mean, mu-diff, being equal to or less than zero. The test statistic, `t`, has a slightly simpler equation compared to the two sample case. We have one statistic, so the number of degrees of freedom is the number of pairs minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the p-value {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the test statistic, we need the number of rows in the dataset, one hundred, and the standard deviation of the differences. We already calculated x-bar-diff, the mean of the differences, as minus two-point-eight-eight. Assuming the null hypothesis is true means mu-diff is zero. We now have everything we need to plug into the equation to calculate t. It's minus five-point-six. The degrees of freedom are one less than n-diff at ninety nine. Finally, we transform `t` with the t-distribution CDF. The `p-value` is really small at around nine-point-six times ten to the minus eight. That means we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the Republican candidates got a smaller percentage of the vote in 2008 compared to 2012.\n",

    "#### Testing differences between two means using `ttest()` {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a lot of calculating. Fortunately, there's an easier way. The `pingouin` package provides a variety of different methods for hypothesis testing and returns the results as a pandas DataFrame. Its output can be a little friendlier to work with than similar methods from `scipy.stats`. One method from `pingouin` is `ttest` and it works with array-like objects, so the first argument is the Series of differences. For a converted one sample test like this, `y` specifies the hypothesized difference value from the null hypothesis, which is zero. The type of alternative hypothesis can be specified as two-sided, less, or greater, corresponding to two-tailed, left-tailed, and right-tailed tests, respectively. Here's the output. We can recognize the value of the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, the alternative direction, and the p-value. The additional output refers to more advanced statistical concepts that are outside the scope of this course.\n",

    "#### `ttest()` with `paired=True` {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a variation of `ttest` for paired data that requires even less work. Rather than calculating the difference between the two paired variables, we can just pass them both directly to `ttest` as `x` and `y`, and set `paired` to `True`. Notice that the results in the first four columns are the same as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unpaired `ttest()` {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't set paired to True and instead perform an unpaired t-test, then the numbers change. The test statistic is closer to zero, there are more degrees of freedom, and the p-value is much larger. Performing an unpaired t-test when our data is paired increases the chances of false negative errors.\n",

    "The Stack Overflow survey includes a job satisfaction variable, with five categories from `\"Very satisfied\"` down to `\"Very dissatisfied\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing multiple distributions {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to know if mean annual compensation is different for each of the levels of job satisfaction. The first thing to do is visualize the distributions with box plots. Seaborn's boxplot method provides a nice option here with `converted_comp` on the horizontal axis and `job_sat` on the vertical axis using the `stack_overflow` data. \"Very satisfied\" looks slightly higher than the others, but to see if they are significantly different, we'll need to use hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of variance (ANOVA) {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA tests determine whether there are differences between the groups. We begin by setting our significance level to point-two. This value is larger than in many situations but will help us understand the implications on comparing different numbers of groups later on. We use the `pingouin anova` method to compare values across multiple groups. We specify the data as `stack_overflow`, the dependent variable,` dv`, as `converted_comp`, and the column of groups to calculate between as `job_sat`. The p-value is stored in the `p-unc` column, which is point-zero-zero-one-three, which is smaller than alpha at 20 percent. That means that at least two of the categories of job satisfaction have significant differences between their compensation levels, but this doesn't tell us which two categories they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pairwise tests {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify which categories are different, we compare all five job satisfaction categories, testing on each pair in turn. There are ten ways of choosing two items from a set of five, so we have ten tests to perform. Our significance level is still point-two.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run all these hypothesis tests in one go, we can use `pairwise_tests`. The first three arguments of data, `dv`, and between are the same as the `anova` method. We'll discuss p-adjust shortly. The result shows a DataFrame where A and B are the two levels being compared on each row. Next, we look at the `p-unc` column of p-values. Three of these are less than our significance level of point-two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As the number of groups increases... {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have five groups, resulting in ten pairs. As the number of groups increases, the number of pairs - and hence the number of hypothesis tests we must perform - increases quadratically. The more tests we run, the higher the chance that at least one of them will give a false positive significant result. With a significance level of point-two, if we run one test, the chance of a false positive result is point-two. With five groups and ten tests, the probability of at least one false positive is around point-seven. With twenty groups, it's almost guaranteed that we'll get at least one false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonferroni correction {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is to apply an adjustment to increase the p-values, reducing the chance of getting a false positive. One common adjustment is the Bonferroni correction. Looking at the `p-corr` column corresponding to corrected p-values, as opposed to the `p-unc` column for `uncorrected`, only two of the pairs appear to have significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More methods {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "`pingouin` provides several options for adjusting the p-values with some being more conservative than others. No adjustment with none is the default, but in almost all pairwise t-testing situations choosing a correction method is more appropriate.\n",

    "## Chapter 3: Proportion Tests {#sec-Chapter3}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s time to test for differences in proportions between two groups using proportion tests. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll extend your proportion tests to more than two groups with chi-square independence tests, and return to the one sample case with chi-square goodness of fit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chapter 3.1: One-sample proportion tests {#sec-Chapter3.1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to thinking about testing proportions, as we did in @sec-Chapter1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chapter 1 recap {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis tests in @sec-Chapter1 measured whether or not an unknown population proportion was equal to some value. We used bootstrapping on the sample to estimate the standard error of the sample statistic. The standard error was then used to calculate a standardized test statistic, the z-score, which was used to get a p-value, so we could decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. A bootstrap distribution can be computationally intensive to calculate, so this time we'll instead calculate the test statistic without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standardized test statistic for proportions {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "An unknown population parameter that is a proportion, or population proportion for short, is denoted p. The sample proportion is denoted p-hat, and the hypothesized value for the population proportion is denoted p-zero. As in @sec-Chapter1, the standardized test statistic is a z-score. We calculate it by starting with the sample statistic, subtracting its mean, then dividing by its standard error. p-hat minus the mean of p-hat, divided by the standard error of p-hat. Recall from Sampling in Python that the mean of a sampling distribution of sample means, denoted by p-hat, is p, the population proportion. Under the null hypothesis, the unknown proportion p is assumed to be the hypothesized population proportion p-zero. The z-score is now p-hat minus p-zero, divided by the standard error of p-hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplifying the standard error calculations {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For proportions, under H-naught, the standard error of p-hat equation can be simplified to p-zero times one minus p-zero, divided by the number of observations, then square-rooted. We can substitute this into our equation for the z-score. This is easier to calculate because it only uses p-hat and n, which we get from the sample, and p-zero, which we chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why z instead of t? {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "We might wonder why we used a z-distribution here, but a t-distribution in @sec-Chapter2. This is the test statistic equation for the two sample mean case. The standard deviation of the sample, s, is calculated from the sample mean, x-bar. That means that x-bar is used in the numerator to estimate the population mean, and in the denominator to estimate the population standard deviation. This dual usage increases the uncertainty in our estimate of the population parameter. Since t-distributions are effectively a normal distribution with fatter tails, we can use them to account for this extra uncertainty. In effect, the t-distribution provides extra caution against mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis. For proportions, we only use p-hat in the numerator, thus avoiding the problem with uncertainty, and a z-distribution is fine.\n",

    "Returning to the Stack Overflow survey, let's hypothesize that half of the users in the population are under thirty and check for a difference. Let's set a significance level of point-zero-one. In the sample, just over half the users are under thirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables for z {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get the numbers needed for the z-score. p-hat is the proportion of sample rows where `age_cat` equals under thirty. p-zero is point-five according to the null hypothesis. n is the number of rows in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the z-score {.unnumbered}\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the p-value {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For left-tailed alternative hypotheses, we transform the z-score into a p-value using `norm.cdf`. For right-tailed alternative hypotheses, we subtract the `norm.cdf` result from one. For two-tailed alternative hypotheses, we check whether the test statistic lies in either tail, so the p-value is the sum of these two values: one corresponding to the z-score and the other to its negative on the other side of the distribution. Since the normal distribution PDF is symmetric, this simplifies to twice the right-tailed p-value since the z-score is positive. Here, the p-value is less than the significance level of point-zero-one, so we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the proportion of users under thirty is not equal to point-five.\n",

    "The Stack Overflow survey contains a hobbyist variable. The value \"Yes\" means the user described themselves as a hobbyist and \"No\" means they described themselves as a professional. We can hypothesize that the proportion of hobbyist users is the same for the under thirty age category as the thirty or over category, which is a two-tailed test. More formally, the null hypothesis is that the difference between the population parameters for each group is zero. Let's set a significance level of point-zero-five.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the z-score {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the z-score equation for a proportion test. Let's break it down. The sample statistic is the difference in the proportions for each category. That's the two `p-hat` values in the numerator. We subtract the hypothesized value of the population parameter, and assuming the null hypothesis is true, it's zero. The denominator is the standard error of the sample statistic. We can again avoid having to generate a bootstrap distribution to calculate the standard error by using a standard error equation, which is a slightly more complicated version of the one sample case. Note that `p-hat` is a weighted mean of the sample proportions for each category, also is known as a pooled estimate of the population proportion. `p-hat` can be calculated using the following equation. This looks horrendous, but Python is great at handling arithmetic. We now only need four numbers from the sample dataset to perform these calculations and calculate the z-score: the proportion of hobbyists in each age group, and the number of observations in each age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting the numbers for the z-score {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate these four numbers, we group by the age category, and calculate the sample proportions using `.value_counts`, and the row counts using `.count`. As we're looking at the proportion of hobbyists, we'll only be focusing on rows where hobbyist is Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To isolate the hobbyist proportions from `p_hats`, we can use pandas' multiIndex subsetting, passing a tuple of the outer column and inner column values. This returns a sample proportion of point-77 for the at least thirty group, and point-84 for the under thirty's.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of observations in each age category can be extracted with simpler pandas subsetting. There are 1050 rows in the at least thirty group and 1211 for the under 30 group.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we can do the arithmetic using our equations for `p_hat`, the standard error, and the z-score to get the test statistic. This returns a z-score of minus four-point-two-two. Luckily, we can avoid much of this arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proportion tests using `proportions_ztest()` {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The `proportions_ztest` function from `statsmodels` can calculate the z-score more directly. This function requires two objects as NumPy arrays: the number of hobbyists in each age group, and the total number of rows in each age group. We can get these numbers by grouping by `age_cat`, and calling `.value_counts` on the hobbyist column, as shown above. The numbers can then either be read-off or subsetted to create the arrays. Next, we import `proportions_ztest` from `statsmodels.stats.proportions`, and pass the arrays to the count and nobs arguments. Because we're testing for a difference, we specify that this is a two-sided test using the alternative argument. `proportions_ztest` returns a z-score and a p-value. The p-value is smaller than the five percent significance level we specified, so we can conclude that there is a difference in the proportion of hobbyists between the two age groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just as ANOVA extends t-tests to more than two groups, chi-square tests of independence extend proportion tests to more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revisiting the proportion test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the proportions test from the last @sec-Chapter3.2. The test statistic is the z-score of minus four-point-two-two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independence of variables {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "That proportion test had a positive result. The small p-value suggested that there was evidence that the hobbyist and age category variables had an association. If the proportion of hobbyists was the same for each age category, the variables would be considered statistically independent. More formally, two categorical variables are consider statistically independent when the proportion of successes in the response variable is the same across all categories of the explanatory variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test for independence of variables {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pingouin` package has an indirect way of testing the difference in the proportions from the previous @sec-Chapter2.3. To the `chi2_independence` method, we pass `stack_overflow` as data, `hobbyist` as `x`, and `age_cat` as `y`. The correction argument specifies whether or not to apply Yates' continuity correction, which is a fudge factor for when the sample size is very small and the degrees of freedom is one. Since each group has over one hundred observations, we don't need it here. The method returns three different pandas DataFrames: the expected counts, the observed counts, and statistics related to the test. Let's look at stats and focus on the `pearson` test row and the `chi2` and `pval` columns. The p-value is the same as we had with the z-test of around two in one hundred thousand. The `chi2` value is the squared result of our z-score seen in the previous @sec-Chapter3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Job satisfaction and age category {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try another example. Recall that the Stack Overflow sample has an age category variable with two categories and a job satisfaction variable with five categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring the hypotheses {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can declare hypotheses to test for independence of these variables. Here, age category is the response variable, and job satisfaction is the explanatory variable. The null hypothesis is that independence occurs. Let's use a `significance level` of `point-one`. The test statistic is denoted chi-square. It quantifies how far away the observed results are from the expected values if independence was true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory visualization: proportional stacked bar plot {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the data using a proportional stacked bar plot. We begin by calculating the proportions in each age group. Next, we use the unstack method to convert this table into wide format. Using the plot method and setting kind to bar and stacked to True produces a proportional stacked bar plot.\n",
    "If the age category was independent of job satisfaction, the split between the age categories would be at the same height in each of the five bars. There's some variation here, but we'll need a `chi-square independence test` to determine whether it's a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chi-square independence test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's again use the `chi-square independence test` from `pingouin`. We have `stack_overflow` as the data and `job_sat` and `age_cat` as `x` and `y`. We leave out a correction here since our `degrees of freedom` is `four`, calculated by subtracting one from each of the variable categories and multiplying. The `p-value` is `point-two-three`, which is above the significance level we set, so we conclude that age categories are independent of job satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Swapping the variables? {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Swapping the variables, so age category is the response and job satisfaction is the explanatory variable, we see that the splits for each bar are in similar places.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### chi-square both ways {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run the chi-square test with the variables swapped, then the results are identical. Because of this, we phrase our questions as \"are variables X and Y independent?\", rather than \"is variable X independent from variable Y?\", since the order doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about direction and tails? {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't worry about tails in this test, and in fact, the `chi2_independence` method doesn't have an alternative argument. This is because the chi-square test statistic is based on the square of observed and expected counts, and square numbers are non-negative. That means that chi-square tests tend to be right-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",

    "5. What should you conclude from the hypothesis test? \n",
    "- **Answer**: Reject the null hypothesis and conclude that `vendor_inco_term` and `freight_cost_group` are associated.\n",
    "-  *The test to compare proportions of successes in a categorical variable across groups of another categorical variable is called a chi-square test of independence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chapter 3.4: Chi-square goodness of fit tests {#sec-Chapter3.4}\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time, we used a chi-square test to compare proportions in two categorical variables. This time, we'll use another variant of the chi-square test to compare a single categorical variable to a hypothesized distribution.\n",

    "#### Purple links {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stack Overflow survey contains a fun question about how users feel when they discover that they already visited the top resource, also called a purple link, when trying to solve a coding problem. We can use the `.value-counts` method to get the counts of each group in the `purple_link` column. We also do a little bit of manipulation here to get a nicely structured DataFrame that we can work with later. First, we rename the leftmost column to be `purple_link`, assign the counts to `n`, and finally sort by `purple_link`, so the responses are in alphabetical order. There are four possible answers stored in the `purple_link` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaring the hypotheses {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's hypothesize that half of the users in the population would respond \"Hello, old friend\", and the other three responses would get one sixth each. We can create a DataFrame for these hypothesized results from a dictionary of key-value pairs for each response. We specify the hypotheses as whether or not the sample matches this hypothesized distribution. The test statistic, chi-squared, measures how far the observed sample distribution of proportions is from the hypothesized distribution. Let's set the significance level of point-zero-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesized counts by category {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the `purple_link` distribution, it will help to have the hypothesized counts for each answer, which are calculated by multiplying the hypothesized proportions by the total number of observations in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing counts {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a visualization to see how well the hypothesized counts appear to model the observed counts. The natural way to visualize the counts of a categorical variable is with a bar plot. First, we use `plt.bar` to plot the observed `purple_link` counts, setting the horizontal axis to `purple_link` and the vertical axis to `n`. We set the color of the bars and add a label for a legend. We do the same again for the hypothesized counts, but also add transparency with the alpha argument.\n",
    "We can see that two of the responses are reasonably well-modeled by the hypothesized distribution and another two appear quite different, but we'll need to run a hypothesis test to see if the difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### chi-square goodness of fit test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-sample chi-square test is called a goodness of fit test, as we're testing how well our hypothesized data fits the observed data. To run the test, we use the `chisquare` method from `scipy.stats`. There are two required arguments to chisquare: an array-like object for the observed counts, `f_obs`, and one for the expected counts, `f_exp`. The p-value returned by the function is very small, much lower than the significance level of point-zero-one, so we conclude that the sample distribution of proportions is different from the hypothesized distribution.\n",

    "### Chapter 4.1: Assumptions in hypothesis testing {#sec-Chapter4.1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hypothesis test we've seen so far makes assumptions about the data. It's only when these assumptions are met that it is appropriate to use that hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Randomness {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it uses one or multiple samples, every hypothesis test assumes that each sample is randomly sourced from its population. If we don't have a random sample, then it won't be representative of the population. To check this assumption, we need to know where our data came from. There are no statistical or coding tests we can perform to check this. If in doubt, ask the people involved in data collection, or a domain expert that understands the population being sampled.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Independence of observations {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests also assume that each observation is independent. There are some special cases like paired t-tests where dependencies between two samples are allowed, but these change the calculations, so we need to understand where such dependencies occur. As we saw with the paired t-test, not accounting for dependencies results in an increased chance of false negative and false positive errors. Not accounting for dependencies is a difficult problem to diagnose during analysis. Ideally, it needs to be discussed before data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Large sample size {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests also assume that our sample is large enough that the Central Limit Theorem applies, and the sample distribution can be assumed to be normally distributed. Smaller samples incur greater uncertainty, which may mean that the Central Limit Theorem does not apply and the sampling distribution might not be normally distributed. The increased uncertainty of a small sample means we get wider confidence intervals on the parameter we are trying to estimate. If the Central Limit Theorem does not apply, the calculations on the sample, and any conclusions drawn from them, could be nonsense, which increases the chance of false negative and false positive errors. How big our sample needs to be to be \"big enough\" depends on the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Large sample size: t-test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For one sample t-tests, a popular heuristic is that we need at least thirty observations in our sample. For the two sample case or ANOVA, we need thirty observations from each group. That means we can't compensate for one minority group sample by making the majority group bigger. In the paired case, we need thirty pairs of observations. Sometimes we can get away with less than 30 in each of these tests; the important thing is that the null distribution appears normal. This is often the case at around 30 and that's the reason for this somewhat arbitrary threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Large sample size: proportion tests {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For one sample proportion tests, the sample is considered big enough if it contains at least ten successes and ten failures. Notice that if the probability of success is close to zero or close to one, then we need a bigger sample. In the two sample case, we require ten successes and ten failures from each sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "One more check we can perform is to calculate a bootstrap distribution and visualize it with a histogram. If we don't see a bell-shaped normal curve, then one of the assumptions hasn't been met.

We set a significance level of one percent and use the `ttest` method from `pingouin` to perform the left-tailed paired t-test. The small p-value indicates we should reject the null hypothesis, leading us to suspect that the 2008 election had a smaller percentage of Republican votes than the 2012 election.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-parametric tests {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where we aren't sure about these assumptions, or we are certain that the assumptions aren't met, we can use non-parametric tests. They do not make the normal distribution assumptions or the sample size conditions that we saw in the previous video. There are many different ways to perform tests without these parametric assumptions. In this chapter, we'll focus on those relating to ranks. Consider the list, x. The first value of x, one, is the smallest value and the second value, fifteen, is the fifth smallest. These orderings from smallest to largest are known as the ranks of the elements of x. We can access them with the `rankdata` method from `scipy.stats`.\n",

    "The last part of our calculation involves calculating a test statistic called W. W uses the signs of the diff column to split the ranks into two groups: one for rows with negative differences and one for positive differences. T-minus is defined as the sum of the ranks with negative differences, and T-plus is the sum of the ranks with positive differences. For this example, all the differences are negative, so the T-minus value is the sum of the five ranks, and T-plus is zero. The test statistic W is the smaller of T-minus and T-plus, which in this case, is zero. We can calculate W, and its corresponding p-value, using a `pingouin` method instead of manual calculation.\n",

This corresponds to a p-value of around three percent, which is over ten times larger than the p-value from the t-test, so we should feel more confident with this result given the small sample size.

    "### Chapter 4.3: Non-parametric ANOVA and unpaired t-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter @sec-Chapter4.2, we explored some non-parametric techniques and how they compare to their parametric counterparts. We'll continue on that theme here focusing on non-parametric alternatives to tests of independent numeric samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid assumptions about normally distributed data by performing hypothesis tests on the ranks of a numeric input. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is, very roughly speaking, a t-test on ranked data. This test is similar to the Wilcoxon test we saw in the last video, but works on unpaired data instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test setup {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the StackOverflow survey and the relationship between converted compensation and the age respondents began coding. We start by focusing on just those two columns in a new DataFrame called `age_vs_comp`. To conduct a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with `pingouin`, we first need to convert our data from long to wide format. This is accomplished with the `pivot` method from pandas, which unlike `pivot_table`, does not aggregate; instead, it returns the raw values for each group across the rows. We now have our data in two columns named adult and child with the values corresponding to the `converted_comp` entries for each row. An adult value of NaN corresponds to a child entry and a child value of NaN corresponds to an adult entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set a significance level of one percent. We can run a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test using `mwu` from `pingouin`. It accepts x and y arguments corresponding to the two columns of numbers we want to compare, in this case, child and adult. alternative sets the type of alternative hypothesis, in this case, that those who code first as children have a higher income than those who code first as adults, which is a right-tailed test. Here, the p-value is shown as around ten to the negative nineteenth power, which is significantly smaller than the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kruskal-Wallis test {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way that ANOVA extends t-tests to more than two groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test extends the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to more than two groups. That is, the Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric version of ANOVA. We use the `Kruskal` method from `pingouin` to perform a Kruskal-Wallis test to investigate if there is a difference in converted_comp between job satisfaction groups. Unlike the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, we don't need to pivot our data here since the `Kruskal` method works on long data. We pass in `stack_overflow` as data, the dependent variable, dv, as `converted_comp`, and we are comparing between the groups of `job_sat`. Again, the p-value here is very small and smaller than our significance level. This provides evidence that at least one of the mean compensation totals is different than the others across these five job satisfaction groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4.3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney {.unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of non-parametric hypothesis tests are called *rank sum tests*. Ranks are the positions of numeric values from smallest to largest. Think of them as positions in running events: whoever has the fastest (smallest) time is rank 1, second fastest is rank 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating on the ranks of data instead of the actual values, you can avoid making assumptions about the distribution of the test statistic. It's more robust in the same way that a median is more robust than a mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common rank-based test is the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, which is like a non-parametric t-test.\n",
